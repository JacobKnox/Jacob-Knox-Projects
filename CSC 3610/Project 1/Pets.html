    <h1>My Pets</h1> <!-- These are all of my actual pets. I don't know how old they are, honestly, so I made estimations. -->

      <h2>Tigeris</h2>

      <p><strong>Age:</strong> 9 years old</p>
      <p>Tigeris is a black and gray tabby cat that I "got" when my fiancee moved in with us. She's my fiancee's cat, but I consider her just as much my cat as hers.</p>

    <div id="pet2">
      <h2>Blackers</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="Images\blackers.jpg" alt="A cute photo of my sister's cat, Blackers, sitting on the porch with his paws dangling off">

      </figure>
      <p><strong>Age:</strong> 8 years old</p>
      <p>Blackers (also known as Black Black or Black) is a solid black cat, as evident by the name, who is technically my sister's and was born into our home.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="pet3">
      <h2>Cleo</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="Images\cleo.jpg" alt="An image of my mother's cat, Cleo, laying in bed and cuddling the TV remote">

      <p><strong>Age:</strong> 3 years old</p>
      <p>Cleo is a white cat with tanish patterning (including a heart-shaped one) that is technically my mother's. We adopted her from the veterinarian's office in Trenton, FL when she was a kitten.</p>

      <h2>Meow Meow</h2>
      <figure>

      <p>Meow Meow (also know as Meow or Mr. Meow) is a white cat with black spots who is technically my sister's. We adopted him from the veterinarian's office in Trenton, FL. He got his name because of the distinctive way he meowed at the vet's office: a pattern of "meow meow... meow meow."</p>
