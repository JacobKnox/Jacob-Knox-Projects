## [Laravel Practices 2-5](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/tree/main/CSC%204610/Laravel%20Practice)
### Description
Since the Laravel practice assignments, except for Laravel Practice 1, all built on top of one another, the finished product of Laravel Practice 5 is what is visible in this repository. The final result is a more sophisticated version of the cat site in PHP Practices 2 and 3 complete with view and component blades, database connection with migrations and seeders, routing, ability to add cats to the database via a form, and a user system with the basic necessities associated with such a system. Follows the guidelines outlined [here](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/tree/main/CSC%204610/Practice%20Specifications/Laravel%20Practices).

Total Length (including spaces and comments): 194 lines of PHP, 170 lines of Blade, and 25 lines of CSS.
