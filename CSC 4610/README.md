# CSC 4610 Practices
This folder holds all of the practice assignments for my CSC 4610 - Advanced Topics in Web Development (Fall 2022) course at Florida Southern College.

Quick Links:

## [PHP Practice 1]
A basic PHP program that prints a triangle of asterisks, a chess board, factorials, and a "water bill" calculation (using information from the GET array). Follows the guidelines outlined [here].

## [PHP Practice 2]
PHP program that connects with a database with basic information for some cats and displays that information on the page. Follows the guidelines outlined [here].

## [PHP Practice 3]
Expands on [PHP Practice 2] by adding the ability to add cats to the database through a form, delete a cat, and filter cats by whether or not they are considered "senior" (11 years of age or older). Follows the guidelines outlined [here].

## [Laravel Practices 2-5]
Since the Laravel practice assignments, except for Laravel Practice 1, all built on top of one another, the finished product of Laravel Practice 5 is what is visible in this repository. The final result is a more sophisticated version of the cat site in PHP Practices 2 and 3 complete with view and component blades, database connection with migrations and seeders, routing, ability to add cats to the database via a form, and a user system with the basic necessities associated with such a system. Follows the guidelines outlined here.
