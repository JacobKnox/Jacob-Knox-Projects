## [FSC Gradebook](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/tree/main/CSC%203280/FSCgradeBook)

## [FSC Recurse](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/tree/main/CSC%203280/FSCrecurse)
### Description
A simple program that implements four resursive methods:
1. MocsMath - computes the sum of all factorials up to and including an inputted number
2. MocsShape - prints a partial triangle of stars by printing rows of stars from 1 to the number inputted and then from the number inputted to 1
3. MocsGames - returns true or false dependent on whether or not the "game" can be won with the inputted number; the rules of the "game" are: (1) to win, you must reduce the number to 42, (2) if the number is divisible by 2, then you have the option to divide the number in half, (3) if the number is divisible by 3 OR by 4, then you have the option to substract the product of the last two digits from the number, and (4) if the number is divisible by 5, then you have the option to subtract 42 from it
4. MocsHop - returns true or false dependent on whether or not the "game" can be won with the inputted array ("board") and starting point; the rules of the "game" are: (1) to win, you must make it to the end of the "board," (2) every position on the "board" has a non-negative integer representing how far you can "hop" (move) forward or backward on the board, and (3) you cannot leave the "board"

Follows the guidelines outlined [here](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203280/Program%20Guidelines/CSC3280_Program3_Fall2021.pdf).

Total Length (including comments and blank lines): 277 lines.
### Skills Demonstrated
- Knowledge of recursion
- Ability to adhere to strict output requirements
- Ability to write thorough and clear comments
- Ability to use wrapper and helper methods

## [FSC Sharing is Caring](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/tree/main/CSC%203280/FSCsharingiscaring)
### Description
A program that simulates a new "proposed" network system at Florida Southern College where students can opt-in to have their devices used as a mobile hotspot for FSC's internet, which would thus extend the range of the campus' wifi. Each student controls devices that are and are not allowed to access their hotspot.

Follows the guidelines outlined [here](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203280/Program%20Guidelines/CSC3280_Program5_Fall2021.pdf).

Total Length (including comments and blank lines): 817 lines.
