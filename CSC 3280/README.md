# CSC 3280 Projects
This folder holds all of my projects from my CSC 3280 - Data Structures (Fall 2021) course at Florida Southern College. Each project demonstrates my ability to adhere to strict input/output requirements, to write thorough and clear comments, and to program in an object oriented manner.
**All code here is in Java.**

## [FSC Car Clean](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/tree/main/CSC%203280/FSCcarClean)
### Description
A basic program to simulate a "car wash" using [stacks](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203280/FSCcarClean/FSCvouchers.java), [queues](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203280/FSCcarClean/FSCcarCleanQ.java), and objects. Follows the guidelines outlined [here](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203280/Program%20Guidelines/CSC3280_Program4_Fall2021.pdf).

Total Length (including comments and blank lines): 626 lines.

## [FSC Gradebook](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/tree/main/CSC%203280/FSCgradeBook)
### Description
A basic program to simulate a gradebook using arrays, [singly linked lists](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203280/FSCgradeBook/FSCcourseRoster.java), and objects. Follows the guidelines outlined [here](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203280/Program%20Guidelines/CSC3280_Program2_Fall2021.pdf).

Total Length (including comments and blank lines): 769 lines.

## [FSC Recurse](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/tree/main/CSC%203280/FSCrecurse)
### Description
A simple program that implements four resursive methods:
1. MocsMath - computes the sum of all factorials up to and including an inputted number
2. MocsShape - prints a partial triangle of stars by printing rows of stars from 1 to the number inputted and then from the number inputted to 1
3. MocsGames - returns true or false dependent on whether or not the "game" can be won with the inputted number; the rules of the "game" are: (1) to win, you must reduce the number to 42, (2) if the number is divisible by 2, then you have the option to divide the number in half, (3) if the number is divisible by 3 OR by 4, then you have the option to substract the product of the last two digits from the number, and (4) if the number is divisible by 5, then you have the option to subtract 42 from it
4. MocsHop - returns true or false dependent on whether or not the "game" can be won with the inputted array ("board") and starting point; the rules of the "game" are: (1) to win, you must make it to the end of the "board," (2) every position on the "board" has a non-negative integer representing how far you can "hop" (move) forward or backward on the board, and (3) you cannot leave the "board"

Follows the guidelines outlined [here](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203280/Program%20Guidelines/CSC3280_Program3_Fall2021.pdf).

## [FSC Sharing is Caring](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/tree/main/CSC%203280/FSCsharingiscaring)
### Description
A program that simulates a new "proposed" network system at Florida Southern College where students can opt-in to have their devices used as a mobile hotspot for FSC's internet, which would thus extend the range of the campus' wifi. Each student controls devices that are and are not allowed to access their hotspot. The model is implemented with a [binary search tree](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203280/FSCsharingiscaring/FSCscBST.java) of student objects where each student object has a [linked list](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203280/FSCsharingiscaring/FSCscLinkedDevices.java) of devices allowed to connect. Follows the guidelines outlined [here](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203280/Program%20Guidelines/CSC3280_Program5_Fall2021.pdf).

Total Length (including comments and blank lines): 817 lines.

## [Mocs Bank](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/tree/main/CSC%203280/MocsBank)
### Description
A program that simulates a banking system for students at Florida Southern College. Students/Customers can open an account, request the balance on their account, deposit into their account, withdraw from their account, transfer money from their account to another customer's account, and close their account. There is also a command to print all transactions that have been done that day. Follows the guidelines outlined [here](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203280/Program%20Guidelines/CSC3280_Program1_Fall2021.pdf).

Total Length (including comments and blank lines): 609 lines.
