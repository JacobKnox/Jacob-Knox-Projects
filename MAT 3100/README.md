# MAT 3100 Code
This folder holds code from my MAT 3100 - Foundations of Data Analytics course at Florida Southern College. All code uses the cleaned/manipulated [hurricane data](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/MAT%203100/Hurricane%20Data%20-%20Clean%202-2.csv) and [buoy data](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/MAT%203100/Buoy%20Data%20-%20Clean-2.csv) found in this folder. The final report for the course can be found [here](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/MAT%203100/Final%20Report.pdf).
**All code here is in R.**

Quick Links: [Task 5](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/MAT%203100#task-5) | [Task 6](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/MAT%203100#task-6)

## [Task 5](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/MAT%203100/Task5.R)
Reads in the data and manipulates it to ultimately create a multiple regression linear model predicting whether or not the data was from a reading during a storm based on the four variables of interest (barometric pressure, wind speed, atmospheric temperature, and water temperature). Also displays the summary of said model.

Total Length (including spaces and comments): 49 lines of R.

## [Task 6](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/MAT%203100/Task6.R)
Reads in the data and manipulates it to create models from all combinations of the four variables of interest to find which model is the best. This is the code that was ultimately used for the final report mentioned at the top of this README.

Total Length (including spaces and comments): 147 lines of R.
