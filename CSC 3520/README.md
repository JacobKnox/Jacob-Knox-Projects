# CSC 3520 Homeworks
This folder holds all of my homework solutions for my CSC 3520 - Machine Learning (Fall 2022) course at Florida Southern College.

Quick Links:
## [Homework 1 - Naive Bayesian Classifier](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/tree/main/CSC%203520/Homework%201)
Follows the guidelines outlined [here](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203520/Homework%20Guidelines/Homework%201.pdf) to implement a [naive bayesian classifier](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203520/Homework%201/naivebayes.py) that determines what category an article falls under based on the words in the article.

## [Homework 2 - Decision Tree](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/tree/main/CSC%203520/Homework%202)
Follows the guidelines outlined [here](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203520/Homework%20Guidelines/Homework%202.pdf) to implement a [decision tree](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203520/Homework%202/decisiontree.py) that predicts  whether or not someone has 
Parkinsonâ€™s based on dysphonia measurements.

## [Homework 3 - Decision Boundaries](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/tree/main/CSC%203520/Homework%203)
Follows the guidelines outlined [here](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203520/Homework%20Guidelines/Homework%203.pdf) to visual the [decision boundaries](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203520/Homework%203/decisionboundaries.py) created by a simple input-hidden-output (2-2-1) "neural network" with bias.

## [Homework 4 - K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/tree/main/CSC%203520/Homework%204)
Follows the guidelines outlined [here](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203520/Homework%20Guidelines/Homework%204.pdf) to implement a [k-nearest neighbors model](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203520/Homework%204/kdigits.py) and a [support vector machine](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203520/Homework%204/sdigits.py) on the MNIST hand-written digits dataset.
