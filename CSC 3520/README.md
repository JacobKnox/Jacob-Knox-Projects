## [Homework 1 - Naive Bayesian Classifier](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/tree/main/CSC%203520/Homework%201)
Follows the guidelines outlined [here](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203520/Homework%20Guidelines/Homework%201.pdf) to implement a [naive bayesian classifier](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Jacob-Knox-Projects/blob/main/CSC%203520/Homework%201/naivebayes.py) that determines what category an article falls under based on the words in the article.
